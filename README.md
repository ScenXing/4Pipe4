### INTRODUCTION

First of all, thank for downloading CoBiGÂ² 4Pipe4 analysis pipeline. We hope you find it useful.
4Pipe4 allows you to automate NGS data analysis process into a simple script run. It is designed to be as simple to use as possible. 

### INSTALLING

4Pipe4 currently contains no installing system. It is simply a set of scripts that you can run from anywhere you want. Although it is recommended (for simplicity's sake) that you copy them into somewhere in your $PATH.

### FILES

4Pipe4 contains the following files (in alphabetical order):

4Pipe4.py - Main file: this is the script you want to run;
4Pipe4rc - Configuration file;
DiscoveryTCS.py - Module for SNP discovery in TCS files;
LICENSE - License file;
Metrics.py - Module for generating dataset metrics;
ORFmaker.py - Module for finding ORFs;
README - This file;
Reporter.py - Module for generating putative SNP reports;
SNPgrabber.py - Module for organizing SNP information;
SSRfinder.py - Module for finding SSRs;
Templates/Report.html - Template for report "front page"

As time progresses and 4Pipe4 sees new development, this list will be updated.

### REQUIREMENTS

4Pipe4 is written in python 3. Therefore an installation of python 3 is required to run 4Pipe4. If you are using linux you can get python 3 from you distribution's package manager (sudo apt-get install python3 for Ubuntu) or get it from the website (http://python.org/download/)
Not exactly required, but recommended are the external program that 4Pipe4 uses in it's process. By default, these are:

ssf_extract (http://bioinf.comav.upv.es/sff_extract/)
seqclean (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software/)
mira (http://mira-assembler.sourceforge.net/)
getorf (http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/cvs/emboss/apps/getorf.html)
blast (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/)
blast2go4pipe (http://bioinfo.cipf.es/aconesa/software.html)
etandem (http://helixweb.nih.gov/emboss/html/etandem.html)
7zip (http://www.7-zip.org/)

You should also have a local database of NCBI's Univec (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html) and nr (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/) or equivalent.
Once again, if you are in linux keep in mind that some of these programs are likely in your distribution's repositories (such as 7zip or blast).

### USAGE

Using 4Pipe4 should be relatively simple. Simply calling 4Pipe4.py should print the following help message:

--------------------------------------------
Program usage:
    "python3 4Pipe4.py -i sff_file -o basefile [-c configfile] [-n [1,2,...,8,9]]"
    Where:
    "sff_file" is the full path to your target sff file;
    "basefile" is the full path to your results directory, plus the name you 
want to give your results;
    "configfile" is optional and is the full path to your configuration file.
If none is provided, the program will look in the current working directory and 
then to ~/.config/4Pipe4rc (in this order) for one. If none is found the 
program will stop;
    The list after "-n" must be given inside square brackets, and each number 
must be separated with a ",". The numbers are the pipeline steps the should NOT 
be run. This is an optional argument. The numbers, from 1 to 9 represent the 
following steps:
    1 - SFF extraction
    2 - SeqClean
    3 - Mira
    4 - DiscoveryTCS
    5 - SNP grabber
    6 - Report Maker
    7 - Blast2go
    8 - SSR finder
    9 - 7zip the report
    The idea here is that to resume an analysis that was interrupted for 
example after the assembling process you should issue "-n [1,2,3]". Note that 
some steps depend on the output of previous steps, so using some combinations 
of exceptions can cause errors.
    The arguments can be given in any order.

--------------------------------------------

If you wish to run the entire pipeline, just issue something like "4Pipe4rc.py -i /path/to/file.sff -o /path/to/results/basefilename -c /path/to/4Pipe4rc".
Use the -n option to exclude any steps you do not wish to run from the analysis.
Most of 4Pipe4's options are defined in the 4Pipe4rc file; check below for details.

### CONFIGURATION

The configuration file contains information on every option. You should change those options to reflect your own system.
