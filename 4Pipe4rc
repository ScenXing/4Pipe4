##CoBiGÂ² 4Pipe4 configuration file
##Lines that begin with a "#" are comments and they are not read
##by the program. They are used only to describe the options.

##The pipeline requires access to several programs which can
##differ from system to system. Here is where we steup the paths
##to each of the required programs.

#Please use the FULL PROGRAM PATHS!
#eg. "/home/user/software/mira" instead of "~/software/mira"
